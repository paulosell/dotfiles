# hyper

Hyper is a terminal built on open web standards that allow users to create a beautiful and extensible experience for command-line interface users.

## Rerequisites

I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as main font for  hyper terminal. Therefore, the installation of Fira Code is needed.

```shell
$ sudo apt install fonts-firacode
```

## Installation

Hyper installation is pretty straight forward. Just need to download the .deb file in the [official page](https://hyper.is/#installation).

## Plugins and themes

- Install 
[hyper dracula](https://hyper.is/store/hyper-dracula) 
```
$ hyper i hyper-dracula
```

:warning: Hyper is configured to use [zsh](../oh-my-zsh/) as default shell.
